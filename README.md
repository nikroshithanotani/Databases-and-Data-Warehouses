# Databases-and-Data-Warehouses

We designed a database system for Car Rental. 

Our database system for Car Rental efficiently manages interconnected entities such as Customer, Account, Car, Order, Store, and Store Representative,
ensuring seamless operations and comprehensive data management.

By enforcing constraints such as one-to-one relationships between Customer and Account, and one-to-many relationships between Store Representative and Car,
our design promotes data integrity and facilitates smooth interactions within the Car Rental system.
